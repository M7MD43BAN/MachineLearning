It was the Chinese who taught the art of ice cream making to the Indians, the Persians and the Arabs. Ice cream and water ices were introduced into France about the year 1660 by a Sicilian named Francisco Procopio. Under the Second Empire, the first coupes, mousses and parfaits were made. The name Petits Four, according to Careme, comes from the fact that they are baked  in a slow oven after the big cakes have been baked, and the temperature of the oven has gone down considerably.",,1,1,1966,1966,,,12
